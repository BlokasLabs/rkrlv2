I'm porting this, but it really ends up being an issue of creating a lot of meta-data. So I may only do the ones I really care about. Also it takes a fair bit of refactoring.

1st thing to note is that I use cmake, out of habit and the rest of the project uses straight auto-tools. One of the primary goals of this project (lv2 porting) is to make NO changes to the source so any upstream changes will not require additional work. This goal is impossible when one wants to produce stable code due to using globals in a shared library object. So everything is getting refactored as it is ported. These changes are designed so that they can be merged back into the main project but it will require some refactoring of other code that I do not use in the plugins.

Eventually I'd like to port them all, but we'll see if my interest lasts that long. You can always request something.

[X] Chorus 
[W] Phaser - I'm not planning to do this, but it's negotiable. I'm only interested in the analog phaser version
[X] Analog Phaser 
[W] Flanger - this is identical to the chorus, presets from this will be included there
[X] Reverb 
[X] Parametric EQ 
[X] Cabinet Emulation - created new class for it 
[X] AutoPan/Stereo Expander 
[+] Harmonizer - still need to do midi mode version
[X] Musical Delay

[X] WahWah 
[X] AlienWah 
[X] Derelict 
[X] Valve 
[X] Dual Flange 
[X] Ring 
[X] Exciter 
[X] DistBand 
[X] Arpie 
[X] Expander 
[X] Shuffle 
[X] Synthfilter 
[X] VaryBand 
[W] Convolotron - these require special input files, adding complexity. other excellent lv2 convolution engines already exist
[W] Looper - other good lv2 loopers exist
[X] MuTroMojo 
[X] Echoverse 
[X] CoilCrafter 
[X] ShelfBoost 
[X] Vocoder 
[X] Sustainer 
[X] Sequence 
[X] Shifter 
[X] StompBox - extra effect was made for fuzz
[X] Reverbtron 
[X] Echotron 
[+] StereoHarm - no midi
[X] CompBand 
[X] Opticaltrem 
[X] Vibe 
[X] Infinity


===== NOTES ======

each effect:
change nparams and effect index
lfo switch to reference, add PERIOD member and set before setparam()
Fpre add pdata arg
add destructor deletes
lets make generic stompbox and then a sb_fuzz with better labels


* added a cabinet class and presets are managed there.
* changed dynamic filter so that filter type is set in changepar instead of setpreset. Need to add this on gui
* rakarrack gui shuffle preset sets 2 controls to parameter(2)
* changed combi param of varyband (mbvvol) so that you can individually select all 4 params (won't fit on gui though) combi still works
